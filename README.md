This is a project to learn Rust by developing a very simple game.

It uses the [piston game engine](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston).

So far I achieved:

* loading images
* continue parallax side scrolling of the background
* key board control: p for start/stop, arrow buttons for directions
